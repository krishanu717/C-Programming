1. Write a program to repeatedly prompt the user to enter a 
positive integer until they enter a negative integer. Print the sum of all positive integers entered.

2. Write a program to repeatedly ask the user for a number until they enter 0. 
Calculate and print the sum of all the numbers entered.

3. Write a program to simulate rolling a six-sided die until a 6 is rolled.
 Print the number of rolls it took to get a 6.

4. Write a program to repeatedly prompt the user to enter a password 
until they enter the correct password "password123". Print a message indicating success once the correct password 
is entered.

5. Write a program to repeatedly ask the user for a number until they enter
 a number that is divisible by both 2 and 3. Print the first number that meets this condition.

6. Write a program to print the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number `n` using a `do-while` loop.

7. Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number `n` using a `do-while` loop.

8. Write a program to repeatedly ask the user to enter two numbers until both numbers are even.
 Print the product of the two numbers once both are even.

9. Write a program to simulate a guessing game. 
Generate a random number between 1 and 100, and repeatedly prompt the user to guess the number until
 they guess correctly. Print the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.

10. Write a program to repeatedly prompt the user to enter a character until they enter the character 'q'. 
Print all characters entered before 'q' is entered.

These questions should cover a range of difficulty levels and concepts involving `do-while` loops.

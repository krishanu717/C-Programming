 Easy:
   1.Write a function called `sayHello` that prints "Hello, world!" when called. 
   Call this function from the `main` function.

   
   2.Write a function called `add` that takes two integers as input and returns their sum. 
   Call this function from the `main` function and print the result.

  3.Write a function called `isEven` that takes an integer as input and returns `1` if the number is even and `0` 
  if it's odd. Call this function from the `main` function to determine if a user-entered number is even or odd.



Medium:
  1 Write a function called `isPrime` that takes an integer as input and returns `1` if the number is prime and `0` if it's not. 
  Call this function from the `main` function to determine if a user-entered number is prime.

  2.Write a function called `reverseString` that takes a string as input and returns its reverse.
   Call this function from the `main` function to reverse a user-entered string and print the result.

  3.Write a function called `calculateAverage` that takes an array of integers and its size as input and returns
   the average of the numbers in the array. Call this function from the `main` function to calculate the average
    of a user-entered array of numbers.

Hard:
  1. Write a function called `binarySearch` that takes a sorted array of integers, its size, and a 
  target value as input and returns the index of the target value in the array using binary search.
   Call this function from the `main` function to search for a user-entered target value in a sorted array.

   2.Write a function called `mergeSort` that takes an array of integers and its size as input and sorts 
   the array using the merge sort algorithm. Call this function from the `main` function to sort a user-entered 
   array of numbers and print the sorted array.
